/// tint, blur, saturation, inner transparency) and its [refraction]
/// (how it bends the content behind it).
///
/// This is the single styling vocabulary shared across the library —
/// `LiquidGlassLens`, the internal lens config, and the components
/// (buttons, bars, the nav pill, …) all describe their glass with the
/// same object. A surface is fully `geometry` (where + how big) +
/// **style** (how it looks) + behavior (how it acts).

/// Non-refracting consumers — e.g. the static (non-glass) selection pill
/// or the frosted fallback — read the subset they can render ([shape] +
/// [appearance]) and simply ignore [refraction].
