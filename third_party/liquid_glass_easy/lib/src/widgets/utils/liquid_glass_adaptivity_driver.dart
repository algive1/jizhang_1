/// The single adaptivity verdict machine shared by every adaptive
/// widget (lens, scroll edge, nav bar, adaptive area).
///
/// It owns the whole state that used to be copy-pasted per widget:
/// verdict resolution in priority order (manual `permanentBrightness` →
/// followed link → sampled luminance with hysteresis → platform
/// brightness), first-verdict seeding, the animated palette flip, and
/// publishing to a [LiquidGlassAdaptivityLink] when one is attached.
///
/// The owning widget stays responsible for everything widget-shaped:
/// registering itself with a view's sampler (and forwarding samples via
/// [onLuminance]), calling [sync] every build, wrapping its adaptive
/// subtree in an `AnimatedBuilder` on [listenable], reading the frame's
/// colors through [glassColor]/[contentColor], and calling [dispose].
///
/// Behavior contract (pinned by test/adaptivity_behavior_test.dart):
///  • a first verdict resolved during [sync] (manual / platform /
///    re-enable — i.e. before anything wrong could paint) lands
///    instantly; a first verdict arriving asynchronously after frames
///    already painted (sampler, link) ANIMATES in, so the default
///    palette fades into the real one instead of snapping;
///  • before any verdict the palettes sit on the guess —
///    `initialBrightness`, else the platform brightness — so a
///    confirming first verdict causes no motion at all;
///  • a verdict resolved before the flip controller exists seeds the
///    controller on creation, so the first real flip still animates;
///  • disabling adaptivity resets all state, so a re-enable starts
///    fresh (instant first verdict, no stale animation);
///  • a disabled `LiquidGlassAdaptivityController` HOLDS: sampled and
///    linked verdicts are ignored (the palette freezes where it is),
///    while a manual `permanentBrightness` still applies; on resume
///    the next verdict animates in — even one resolved inside the
///    resync's build — and [onResync] asks the owner to rebuild so
///    sampling registration follows the switch;
///  • `adaptOnce()` on a disabled controller arms a ONE-SHOT: the
///    widget re-registers, exactly one delivered verdict (sample or
///    link — a dead-zone sample counts too) animates in and consumes
///    the request, then the hold resumes; a publisher whose one-shot
///    verdict came out unchanged re-delivers the link value so held
///    followers complete the same request; enable() voids a pending
///    one-shot, and a fresh driver never reads controller history as
///    a request;
///  • a driver-role link is published post-frame when mid-build, so
///    sibling followers are never notified during a build.
