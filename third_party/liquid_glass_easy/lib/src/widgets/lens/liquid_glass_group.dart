/// Draws every `LiquidGlassLens` beneath it as **one** sheet of glass.
///
/// The members keep their own layout, their own shape and their own child;
/// what they give up is their individual glass pass. In its place the group
/// paints a single surface covering all of them — one backdrop read and one
/// material for the whole set, instead of one of each per lens.
///
/// ```dart
/// LiquidGlassGroup(
///   style: LiquidGlassStyle(adaptivity: myPalette),
///   child: Column(children: [ ...lenses... ]),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// **[smoothness] decides whether they also fuse, and defaults to none:**
/// the group still draws them as one surface with one read, but each member
/// keeps its own hard outline, and the shader skips the smooth-union entirely
/// rather than running it and finding nothing to blend. Give it a radius and
/// members that come within about half of it flow together through a metaball
/// bridge.
///
/// That makes this widget `LiquidGlassBlender` with a different default —
/// `smoothness: 0` there says the same thing.
///
/// **Adaptivity is per member.** Each lens judges the background behind
/// itself and paints its own verdict into the shared sheet; where two of them
/// fuse, their colours cross over inside the bridge, on the same falloff that
/// shapes it. A member that is not adaptive takes the group's colour. Put
/// `adaptivity` on the group's [style] as well and it supplies the fallback
/// colour and the content palette for the subtree.
///
/// Two to [maxLensCount] members. Place the group inside a `LiquidGlassView`
/// for the Skia / web capture path; on Impeller it reads the live backdrop.
///
/// ## Deprecated
///
/// `LiquidGlassBlender` does this and nothing is lost in the move: this widget
/// is that one with a different default, and `smoothness: 0` says what a
/// group says. Every other parameter has the same name and the same meaning.
///
/// ```dart
/// // before
/// LiquidGlassGroup(style: myStyle, child: child)
/// // after
/// LiquidGlassBlender(smoothness: 0, style: myStyle, child: child)
/// ```
///
/// Passing a radius carries over unchanged — `LiquidGlassGroup(smoothness: 40)`
/// becomes `LiquidGlassBlender(smoothness: 40)`.

  /// Prefer `null` over a tiny radius. A near-zero radius gets the outline
