///
/// Place it inside a `LiquidGlassView`'s `child`, pinned to an edge,
/// *under* your floating glass elements:
///
/// ```dart
/// Positioned(
///   left: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0, height: 140,
///   child: LiquidGlassScrollEdge(
///     edge: LiquidGlassEdge.bottom,
///     adaptivity: LiquidGlassAdaptivity(...),
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// **Adaptivity (optional).** With [adaptivity] set and an ancestor
/// `LiquidGlassView`, the band registers with the view's shared
/// luminance sampler (same one `LiquidGlassLens` uses — no extra
/// captures) and animates between two tints: `glassColorOnDark` while
/// the background under the band is dark, `glassColorOnLight` while it
/// is light. A [child] placed in the band gets the matching
/// `contentColorOn*` through `IconTheme`/`DefaultTextStyle`, exactly
/// like the lens. Without a view, the verdict falls back to
/// `adaptivity.permanentBrightness`, then platform brightness. With
/// [adaptivity] left `null` the band is a static fade of [color] — no
/// sampling, no animation, no cost beyond one gradient.
///
/// **Blur.** [blur] blurs the backdrop under the band as exactly **one
/// `BackdropFilter`** — one backdrop read, one blur pass, at any sigma
/// and on every backend. It defaults to `5`; pass `0` to switch it off,
/// and then no filter exists in the tree at all. Inside a `LiquidGlassBatch`
/// that pass joins the batch: it reads the batch's one copy of the backdrop
/// instead of taking its own, like every lens in there. The band is pinned
/// over what scrolls under it, so it is an overlap in the batch's sense — see
/// `LiquidGlassBatch` for what that costs and when to keep it out.
///
/// [style] decides only whether that pass is feathered:
/// [LiquidGlassScrollEdgeStyle.soft] — the default — fades the blur out
/// across the band with a `dstIn` ramp so it meets sharp content without
/// a seam, while [LiquidGlassScrollEdgeStyle.hard] leaves it uniform and
/// ends on a line. Neither costs more than the other.
///
/// [curve] shapes the tint's falloff; [blurCurve] shapes the blur's, and
/// by default keeps nearly all of it across the first half of the band
/// so chrome stays legible over what passes under it.
///
/// The fade itself never blocks touches: scrolls and taps pass through
