/// The scaffold's adaptivity: the palettes its glass chrome wears, and

/// Two jobs, deliberately kept apart:
///
///  • **System chrome.** For every side [systemChrome] asks for — the
///    status bar by default — the scaffold pins an invisible strip
///    along that screen edge, the status bar's at the top and the
///    navigation bar's at the bottom, samples it, and drives that bar's
///    icon brightness from the result. A strip judges nothing but its
///    own system bar.
///  • **Chrome palettes.** [adaptivity] is handed down to the app bar,
///    the bottom bar, the action button and any `lenses`, each of which
///    resolves its **own** verdict from the background directly behind
///    itself. One config, one verdict per surface.
///
/// A strip never captures the chrome: the app bar is judged by the
/// pixels behind the app bar, not by the status bar's strip. Coupling
/// goes the other way round — point a strip at an area's link with
/// [topFollowLink] / [bottomFollowLink] and the system bar mirrors
/// that area's verdict. A following strip stops sampling entirely, so
/// it has no region of its own and [topHeight] / [bottomHeight] no
/// longer apply to it.
///
/// The config's own `link` is deliberately never inherited by the
/// chrome — otherwise every surface would follow it by accident.
///
/// A surface escapes the inherited palettes with
/// `LiquidGlassAdaptivity.none`; its own `style.adaptivity` overrides
/// them. `LiquidGlassScaffold.adaptivity` left `null` (the default) →
/// nothing adapts unless a widget opts in itself, and no strip is
